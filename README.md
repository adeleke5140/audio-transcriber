# audio-transcriber

Transcribe audio with OpenAI whisper model

## Why

Interacting with APIs would help me improve my proficiency with NodeJS. I aim to extend that
by building out a Next frontend and communicating with that.

#How to use
1. Clone the repo and install the packages

```
 git clone repo
 npm i
```

2. Get your OpenAI API key and add it to a `.env` file

3. Run

```
  node src/app.js
```

and you are all good to go ðŸš€
